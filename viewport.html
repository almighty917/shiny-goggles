        <p>Dear Shreya,</p>
        <p>
            My lovely bandar, the most wonderful person I've met, happiest birthday and my best wishes to you. 
            Hope you enjoy this beautiful day of yours and be happy 💗.
        </p>
        <p>
            I ain't good at writing letters so don't judge me. So where do I start? Yeah, my best friend! 
            I've always enjoyed spending time texting and talking to you, you really made me happy, and I hope 
            my presence makes you happy too. I wish I could be there with you to celebrate your birthday. 
            Hope we'll celebrate your birthday together someday, and I'm really waiting for the day we meet in 
            person and enjoy it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love it when you tell me about your day or gossip, and I'm really happy that you feel comfortable 
            sharing all your worries and talks. Always tell me when you're having a bad day or something is 
            worrying you. Do not ever hesitate, and don't think you are annoying me. I'll be happy to make you 
            feel better. I have enjoyed each and every day talking to you and all the late-night conversations, 
            and I hope this friendship continues forever and we don't get separated.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm lucky to have a beautiful, adorable, and best person as my best friend. 
            I know I'm not present with you now and can't give you this letter, so this is a small gesture 
            from my side to thank you and wish you a very happy birthday once again 🥳.
        </p>
        <p>With lots of love and hugs!!</p>
        <p>Cheers to many more days together!</p>
